## Introduction

For the final project of my minor Web Development, I was tasked with setting up a tooling system for me and my team. This is something I've always been interested in, so I went and jumped in. It came out pretty great!

The tooling took care of these issues;

* Compile ES8+ Javascript to ES5
* Lints and fixes the Javascript
* Lints and fixes the SCSS
* Compiles SCSS to CSS
* The same CSS gets optimised by PostCSS
* Creates a folder per component with a simple command

I was ecstatic, I made something that really worked nicely and ensured our team would always have consistent code and performance.

## The impact of doing this for the team

It wasn't untill a conversation with my coach Joost that I realised that by doing this, I might have created a lot of pressure for some members of my team.

I was so focussed on delivering a solid tooling that I didn't consider that it might have been very tough to catch up for some of the less experienced members.

Of course the argument can be made that it's also a great chance to catch up with all the exciting possibilities. This is something I will have to ask at the end of the project as it's something I am very curious about.

## The impact on the client

I created this tooling, in a way, this is a dependency for the project. This means that the client will be somewhat forced to adopt this tooling system, which could either work or not work at all.

And then what? It would mean that the system would have been detrimental to the further developing of the project.

## Conclusion

In hindsight, it seems that while I did manage to build something that is very useful, I didn't do it with the required thinking beforehand. I didn't consider the needs of my client or my fellow developers beyond what the tooling should be able to do.

Some good questions to ask or think about in the future would be;

* What do problems does the tooling need to solve?
* What are the wishes of the client in the future?
* Is it likely that the project will get very large?
