# The health risks of being a sitting Developer

## The facts

Being a Developer has many perks, its a great career and has lots of growth potential. However, we also sit a lot, which is very harmful if done excessively.

In an average working day, [people sit for an average of 12 hours per day.](https://www.juststand.org/the-facts/)

Doctors have called sitting 'the new cancer'. It might sound dramatic, but it actually is.

According to an analysis of 13 studies, people who sit an average of 8 or more hours per day and who did no physical activities had a risk of dying similar to those who smoke or are obese.

This table shows just how little energy you use when sitting.

Activity | Energy spent in % above basal metabolic rate 
---------|----------
 Resting | 0 
 Sitting motionless | 3.7
 Sitting while working | 54
 Standing motionless | 13
 Standing while fidgeting | 94
 Walking 1 mile/hour | 154

As you can see, sitting does very little for our energy spent per day.

## The Health Risks

Not expending a decent amount of calories and eating slightly more means that you will easily gain weight.

Obesity leads to many more side effects obviously. It brings high blood pressure with it which increases the work your heart has to perform significantly.

Obesity is a major cause for type 2 diabetes, which in the past only happened in adulthood but now is also starting with children.

In short, it's clear that sitting for prolonged periods of times is incredibly unhealthy.

### Guerilla Games

During my time at Guerrilla Games, my teammembers often reminded me and took me for short walks outside of the office. Other times we would go and play some pool. 

They told me that its easy to get lost in work and that its important for my mental wellbeing to keep doing stuff thats not behind your screen from time to time.

### Microsoft

At Microsoft, there is a Wellness Health Center where employees can go for free health check-ups, diet counseling and wellness coaching. This makes it easy for employees to get their health checked up since there is no excuse of being too busy.

## In conclusion

We developers are in a very fun and exciting spot, except that we have to pay attention to our health. Though it may not look like it initially, sitting down all day is incredibly bad for your health for a multitude of reasons.

The biggest take away is that a lot of companies are paying attention to this now for many reasons, some being to reduce health care costs and others to promote a healthier lifestyle for its employees which can help with being more productive.

Stand up more often, go for a walk, do some stretches. Don't sit for too long.
